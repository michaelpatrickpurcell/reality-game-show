# High Five: The Golden Gauntlet
A two-player strategy game about an elaborate athletics competition that you might see on a reality game show.
The Golden Gauntlet can be played in about one hour and is designed for players who are at least twelve years old.
During the game you will guide a team of five competitors as they navigate a series of obstacle courses.
At the end of each round, you will be awarded points based on your team's performance.
If you can outscore your opponent, then you will win and can claim the coveted Golden Gauntlet.

## Components
- 18 cards
   - 10 competitor cards
      - Each competitor card describes two potential competitors, one on each side. Each competitor is characterized by the set of three colored gems on the left-hand side of their card and the *trait matrix* on the bottom of their card.
   - 6 challenge cards
      - Each challenge card describes two potential obstacles, one on each side. Each obstacle is characterized by the *color* of the large gem in the middle of its card and the *trait* written at the top and bottom of its card. 
  - 2 score cards
- 18 card sleeves
- 2 whiteboard markers
   - You will use these markers to write on the card sleeves throughout the game. If you prefer, you can instead use pencils to write on the cards directly.
- 30 chits
   - Any set of small items such as coins, wooden cubes, stones, etc. can be used as chits. The chits do not all need to be the same. They should be small enough that three chits can fit comfortably on each card.
- 1 first-player token 
   - Any distinctive object can be used as a first-player token. A trophy would be a particularly appropriate choice, the bigger the better.
- 10 competitor tokens (optional)
   - If you prefer, you can use chess pieces in place of the competitor tokens. Each player will need two matching pieces per competitor on their team. For these purposes, consider the king and queen to be a matched pair if two queens of each color are not available. You will place one piece on each competitor card and use the matching piece to track that competitor's position throughout each round.

## Set Up
1. Place each card inside one of the card sleeves.
2. Give one score card to each player.
3. Give one whiteboard marker to each player.
4. Choose one side of the play area to be "north".
   - One player should be seated on the north side of the play area and the other should be seated on the south side.
5. Deal five competitor cards to each player.
6. For each of your competitor cards, choose which side you want to use and then place the card on the table in front of you with that side facing up.
7. Randomly decide who will go first. Give that person the first-player token.
8. Shuffle the challenge cards.
   - Because these cards are two-sided, be sure to randomize both the order of the cards and the orientation of each card.
9. Place the challenge cards in a single row running from west to east in the middle of the play area.
10. Place the competitor tokens for your competitors in the play area just south of the westmost challenge card.

## Gameplay
A complete game takes place over three rounds. During each round, you will guide your team of competitors as they navigate an elaborate obstacle course. Each round ends as soons as five competitors have faced the final obstacle in that round's obstacle course.

### Segments
Each round is divided into *segments*. Starting with the player who has the first-player token, you will take turns choosing one of your competitors to face an obstacle (see below). Each competitor must face one obstacle during each segment. After a competitor faces an obstacle, you should turn their competitor card sideways to indicate that they are *exhausted*. You may not activate a competitor who is exhausted.

At the end of each segment, whoever has the first-player token should pass it to the other player and both players should restore all of their competitor cards to their original rotations. The competitors are no longer exhauseted and may be actiavted during the next segment.

### The Obstacle Courses
Each obstacle course is represented by the challenge cards. 

Each challenge card represents two obstacles, one that the competitors will face during the first half of each round and one that they will face during the second half. 

During each round, the competitors will:
- travel eastward from their starting positions (just south of the westmost challenge card) until they reach the eastmost challenge card.
- move to the north side of the row of challenge cards.
- travel westward until they face the final obstacle (just north of the westmost challenge card).

### Facing Obstacles
On your turn, you will activate one of your competitors. That competitor will then face the obstacle in the same column as their competitor token.

When a competitor faces an obstacle:
1. Count how many gems on that competitor's card match the color of the challenge. Let *m* denote the number of matches.
2. Move the competitor forward to the next obstacle in the course. You must either:
   - **Assist Others:** Bring up to *m* other competitors with you when you move. Collect one chit for every one of your opponent's competitors that you bring with you. Place the chits that you collect on the competitor's competitor card. Each competitor card can have at most three chits on it at any time.
   - **Help Yourself:** Bring up to *m* other competitors with you when you move. Mark one trait point for every one of your opponent's competitors that you bring with you. You must mark trait points that match the trait of the obstacle that you faced.
   - **Bypass Obstacles:** Spend up to *m* chits to travel further when you move. Bypass one obstacle per chit spent. 

**Note:** When you decide to Assist Others or Help Yourself, you must bring as many other competitors with you as possible. If there are more than *m* eligible competitors, then you may choose which ones to bring with you and which to leave behind.

### Prepare for the Next Round
After each round, you should
1. Award points to the top five finishers (see below).
2. Remove all chits from all competitor cards.
3. Perform steps 8-10 of the Set Up to prepare a new obstacle course for the next round (if applicable).

**Note:** Trait points are cumulative throughout the game. Do *not* erase trait point marks on the competitor cards between rounds. 
 
## Scoring
Each race ends as soons as five competitors have faced the final obstacle. Points will be awarded to the top five finishers as follows:

| Place | Points|
|:-----:|:-----:|
| 1     | 5     |
| 2     | 4     |
| 3     | 3     |
| 4     | 2     |
| 5     | 1     |

Mark the points that you score during each round on your score card.

Furthermore, at the end of Round 3, three points will be awarded to each competitor for each column of their trait matrix that they completed throughout the game.

**Note:** A column of a competitor's trait matrix is said to be *completed* if you have marked all of the trait point boxes in that column.
